                    <b>Summary</b><br/>
                    This slideshow allows the viewer to be guided through various
                    time periods in baseball, highlighting important events along the way.
                    Each slide builds upon the last; the final slide
                    provides a complete history, encompassing all previous slides.
                    Important events are noted in yellow circles positioned atop
                    columns and display event details when clicked on. The
                    left and right arrows above each chart allow the viewer
                    to navigate between previous and next slides.

                    <b>Scenes</b><br/>
                    Each scene is represented
                    by one chart on one slide. The first slide, "Expansion Era"
                    shows a time period
                    in baseball where there was significant team expansion
                    which resulted in more Major League Players therefore an
                    upward trend in the number of home runs hit each year. The next
                    slide, "Steroids Era", illustrates an important time in
                    baseball where there was explosive growth in home runs aided
                    by the use of steroids and other performance enhancing drugs. Red
                    bars were used to highlight this period as it clearly shows the
                    significant difference between prior years. The third slide,
                    “Post-Steroids Era”, helps the viewer understand how
                    stringent drug tests and aggressive suspensions caused
                    players to begin abandoning performance enhancing drugs. The
                    fourth slide, “Statcast Era”, again shows a historic increase
                    in home runs due to the Statcast system which tracks every
                    movement on the baseball field and allows players to
                    analyze all facets of their swings. This data illustrates
                    that players can alter their swings to hit the ball
                    harder which is leading to more home runs. The final slide
                    provides a complete view of all time periods, allowing the
                    viewer to explore each year and any events associated.
                    Each slide uses a baseball background image for
                    stylistic effect.

                    <b>Annotations</b><br/>
										As the viewer progresses through the slides, a brief
										narrative is provided and linked to the highlighted portions
										of the slide creating useful annotations. Persistent
										text directly on the chart was minimized in order
										to ensure the chart was uncluttered as much as possible.
										Upon loading the first slide ("Expansion Era"), an
                    annotation box is visible instructing the viewer to
                    interact with the slide by clicking on the orange circles.
                    This annotation fades out after 5 seconds to make
                    room for the next slide. This is done by using D3's
                    <span style="font-family: courier;">transition</span>
                    feature on the opacity of the <span style="font-family: courier;">DIV</span>
                    element.
                    Each orange circle is placed above certain bars in each chart
                    and provides information about important events when clicked on.
                    The color of the circles clearly contrasts
                    with the bar color, making them easy to recognize.
                    When clicked on, a text box appears above the circles with event text.
                    The viewer can close
                    the box by clicking anywhere in the box. A “Close” link is also provided
                    to help dismiss the box. Annotations are cleared between slides.
                    This annotation system uses D3’s
                    <span style="font-family: courier;">.on(“mousedown”)</span>
                    event, triggering the CSS <span style="font-family: courier;">display</span>
                    feature from <span style="font-family: courier;">none</span>
                    to <span style="font-family: courier;">inline-block</span>.
                    Viewers can also hover over bars to see a tooltip with the year and
                    number of home runs. Tooltips are controlled using the X, Y
                    coordinates of the mouse pointer and D3's
                    <span style="font-family: courier;">.on(“mousemove”)</span> feature.
                    Bars also change color when hovering over them for
                    additional delineation. At the top of each slide is a quick
                    narrative about what the slide is trying to convey.

                    <b>Parameters</b><br/>
                    Parameters are used in to control the scenes. For example,
                    each slide represents a time span which in turn controls which bars
                    and events to display. This is done using a start/end year parameter
                    that is passed through each slide. In addition, these parameters
                    are also responsible for choosing which event circles to display.
                    Notice on each slide how the bar color and event visibility
                    change.

                  <div id="essay">
                    <b>Triggers</b><br/>
                    Navigation arrows on each slide trigger the previous and next slides,
                    which in turn fires a D3 transition call to fade in the
                    bar and event elements for that time period. Also notice
                    that the navigation arrows change color when hovered over
                    allowing the viewer to clearly see that they are a clickable
                    action. As noted above,
                    annotation and tooltip triggers using mouse events are also
                    incorporated. Furthermore,
                    depending on which slide is being viewed, certain triggers are
                    fired. For example,
                    the Steroids and Statcast Era bar colors are changed based
                    on their given time periods.
